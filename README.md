# Abstract:
Most of the people in this world like to travel from one place to another no matter
whether it is a small or large distance. The need for a tourism management system
that can manage tourism information with ease is sought after by every tour
management company. Tour Management system is a dynamic website for
tourism business. This travel and tourism application is designed for travel
agencies by which they can manage different tour packages based on the
destinations. By using this, the tour company can tailor tour packages spanning
various destinations at almost every price point. The also implemented search
module allows the administrator to find and update or upgrade the tour packages
with ease. This module can also even be extended to a customer application page
by which customers can find the right tour package for them at every budget,
depending on the tour locations. The main purpose is to help tourism companies
to manage tour packages . The system can also be used for both professional and
business trips. The proposed system maintains a centralized repository to make
necessary travel arrangements and to retrieve information easily.

# Introduction:
Tourism has turned out to be an economic booster contributing to the economic
development of many countries over the last few decades. People see holidays as
a necessity, and not as luxury in the present scenario. Tourism calls for
coordination and cooperation between travel agents, tour operators, and tourists.
Tourism has a few major elements âˆ’ destinations, attractions, sites,
accommodation, and all ancillary services. The need for a robust and dynamic tour
management application has been around since the advent of the tourism concept.
Thus we have developed an application to provide the best travelling services to
the customers and travel agents. The Tourism Management System provides a
search platform where a tourist can find their tour places according to their choices.
This system also helps to promote responsible and interesting tourism so that
people can enjoy their holidays at their favorable places and develop tourism with
different cultures so that they enrich the tourism experience and build pride.
The Tourism Management System is a web based application.The objective of this
project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a
travel agency. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it
executed properly. This project is developed to replace the currently existing
system, which helps in keeping records of the customer details of destination as
well as payment received.The proposed system is highly automated and makes
the travelling activities much easier and flexible. The users can get the very right
information at the very right time.This will increase the trust of the customer into
the tourism company as well.
This project is designed with SQL Server as back end. All the data will be stored
in the server and in case of any data losing situation, a backup will be available by
this server. The details related to every aspect of the tourist will be available
separately. The admins just have to click once and all the details will be available
to them.

# Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
a)Struggled with implementing the whole code and hence use Breakpoint which helps in solving on a particular stream.

b)Updating and Deleting a file was overcame by using a temporary file to store data for some time.
